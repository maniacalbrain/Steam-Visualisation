# Steam-Visualisation

Visualisation of Steam user profiles belonging to myself and some friends. Bar charts showing total time per user per game, top 10 longest game times amoungst the group in Matplot and Bokeh and pie charts of total time played by each user.

I have also created a page that allows a user to input their own steam profile url which shows a bar chart of their past two weeks activity and all time activity which can be found <a href="http://www.anquantarbuile.com/steamidsubmit" target="_blank">here</a> or you can be my profile by clicking <a href="http://www.anquantarbuile.com/steamvis/76561198008481956" target="_blank">here</a>.
